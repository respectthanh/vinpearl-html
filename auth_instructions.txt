VINPEARL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS
=======================================

I've completely rebuilt the authentication system with PHP sessions. Here's how to test it:

1. START THE PHP SERVER:
   ```
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

2. VISIT THE LOGIN PAGE:
   http://localhost:8000/pages/auth/login.php

3. LOGIN WITH YOUR CREDENTIALS:
   - If you don't have an account, use the Register tab to create one.
   - If you already have a user in the database, use those credentials.

4. TEST DEBUGGING TOOLS:
   - Authentication Debug: http://localhost:8000/pages/auth/debug_auth.php
     (Shows session status, login status, and database connection)

5. CHECK LOGIN STATE:
   - After logging in, you should see your user menu in the header
   - The "Sign In" button should be replaced with your user avatar

6. TEST LOGOUT:
   - Click on your username/avatar and select "Logout"
   - You should be redirected to the login page with a success message

IMPORTANT CHANGES:
-----------------
1. Converted to PHP-based authentication (no more AJAX)
2. All pages use header.php and footer.php includes
3. Session-based authentication throughout the site
4. Proper error handling and user feedback
5. Security improvements with prepared statements and password hashing

TESTING TIPS:
------------
- If you encounter issues, check the debug_auth.php page
- Clear your browser cache if you experience unexpected behavior
- Make sure your PHP server is running correctly
- Check database credentials in includes/db_connect.php

For any issues, refer to the debug tools or check the PHP error logs.
